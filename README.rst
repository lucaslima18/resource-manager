Usage

0. Installation
===============

OBS: to install and run this project you must have postgreSQL installed and a database called resource-manager


first go to the /resource_manager/settings.py directory in the following code snippet insert:

.. code:: python

   DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'resource_manager', 
        'USER': 'postgres', 
        'PASSWORD': '{put your password here!}',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1', 
        'PORT': '5432',
      }
    }

with the database properly configured, let's create an env to run our application in an isolated environment:

.. code:: console

  python -m venv venv

then we will activate the virtual env

.. code:: console

  . venv/bin/activate

or 

.. code:: console

  source venv/bin/activate

if you are in a windows environment, run the following command:

.. code:: console

  source venv/scripts/activate

With your virtual env activated, let's now install pipenv so that it can install our dependencies

.. code:: console
   
   pip install pipenv

Now we will install all project dependencies with the command:

.. code:: console
   
   pipenv install

With everything properly installed, it's time to upload the migrations of our database in our project, for that, run the following commands in your terminal:

.. code:: console
   
   python manage.py makemigrations

and then:

.. code:: console
   
   python manage.py migrate

finally, let's start our application

.. code:: console
   
   python manage.py runserver


1. Installation with Docker
===============
To run this program with docker is very simple, just run the following command:

.. code:: console

   docker-compose up --build
   

2. Quickstart
